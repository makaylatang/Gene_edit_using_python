## Finding Restriction Enzyme Cut Sites in a DNA Sequence and Identifying Suitable Enzymes for Cloning

This project involves developing a program that can identify restriction enzyme cut sites in a given DNA sequence and print the names, cut sequences, start and end positions of the enzymes found. The program requires the user to input the filename of a Fasta file containing the DNA sequence. The code will scan the entire sequence for the cut sites of the enzymes provided in the "enzymes" variable. If any cut sites are found, the program will print the necessary information.

Furthermore, the project also requires identifying suitable restriction enzymes for cloning the DNA sequence into a plasmid with a multiple cloning site (MCS). Given that the CDS of the MCS is from position 84 to 2123, the program should output the names of the enzymes in the "enzymes" variable that have cut sites within this range.
